<h2>Basic description:</h2>
<p>Dynasty Warriors 2, known in Japan as Shin Sangokumusō (真・三國無双), is a crowd-combat sequel to the fighting game Dynasty Warriors. It is the second game in the Dynasty Warriors series, but the first in the Shin Sangokumusō series. The game was released in other countries as Dynasty Warriors 2, leading to the discrepancy in title numbers.</p>
<p>From this game onward, the player chooses a playable character general, and plays through a number of levels representing particular conflicts in the time of the three kingdoms, eventually defeating both of the other kingdoms and becoming the ruler of a unified China. However, this game isn't a one-on-one fighting game like the original Dynasty Warriors, but a beat 'em up hack and slash fighting game in full 3D, similar in genre to Fighting Force. Unlike previous games in the beat 'em up genre, Dynasty Warriors 2 allowed players the freedom to roam to any point within the limits of the current stage being played.</p>
<p>This game was the first to introduce Free Mode and Musou Mode to the series. The Free Mode allowed the player to replay any missions that they have already completed in Musou Mode. The Musou Mode is the character's main story, where you play as the officer until the kingdom you are fighting for has unified China. However, due to the small scale of the game at the time, many important battles were missing. This was fixed in Dynasty Warriors 3, as many of the missing battles were added there.</p>

<h2>Where to buy:</h2>
<p> 
<p>It was released as a launch title for the PS2. Since then, there have been no offical rereleases. If you want to buy it today, you will have to get a PS2 and hunt down the game.</p>
<p>Thankfully, actually finding the game is not that hard. Despite being more than twenty year old, it's still easily found in many second hand stores that stock PS2 games. It's generally fairly cheap as well.</p>

    <h2>Personal opinions:</h2>
    <p>Dynasty Warriors 2 is an odd beast. It very much feels like the first instalment of a franchise, though it's technically not in more way than one. While the main core of beat em up "One vs hundreds" action is certainly fun and the stages are pretty well designed. The game is VERY repetitive, even in a series known for being repetitive.</p>
    <p>With only 8 stages, 2 of which you are going to see for literally every character you play, there really isn't much variation to the game. If you want to 100% the game, you are probably going to become more familiar with the Yellow Turban Rebelion and Hulao gate than you are with your wife and not just because she is probably going to leave you for being totally mad. Overall, if you are interested in playing Dynasty Warriors you are probably better off starting with either Dynasty Warriors 3 or 7.</p> 
    <p> Nonetheless, it is certainly worth exploring if you like the series or have interest in PS2 history. The midbattle save system is actually one of the more fun and interesting ones of the entire franchise, while I will never understand why the bar showing how many soldiers you had to defeat to lower morale was removed in the next entry. So, despite its repetitive and somewhat primitive nature the game is hardly entirely without value or unique aspects. It's not particularly hard to track down either.</p>
