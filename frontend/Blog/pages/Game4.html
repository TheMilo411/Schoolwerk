<h2>Basic description:</h2>
<p>
Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters is a 1992 video game, the sequel to Star Control. It was developed by Toys for Bob (Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III) and originally published by Accolade in 1992 for MS-DOS. This game features exoplanet-abundant star systems, hyperspace travel, extraterrestrial life, and interstellar diplomacy, with the game featuring 25 different alien races with which communication is possible.[1]
Released to critical acclaim, Star Control II is widely viewed today as one of the greatest PC games ever made,[2] and has appeared on numerous publications lists of the greatest video games of all time.[3]
The game was ported to the 3DO by Crystal Dynamics in 1994 with an enhanced multimedia presentation, allowed by the CD technology. The source code of the 3DO port was licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later in 2002,[4] the game content under CC-BY-NC-SA-2.5. The 3DO code was ported to PC as The Ur-Quan Masters. A sequel, Star Control 3, was released back in 1996.

<h2>Where to buy:</h2>
<p>The game is generally available on most digital stores, like Steam or Good old games. I would personally however reccomend the open source port: The Ur-Quan Masters. Which is easily found online and contains many improvments and features not in the version on Digital storefronts. Including the voice acting, which is something to behold.</p>

    <h2>Personal opinions:</h2>
    <p>Easily the oldest game on this list and, fittingly, probably the most intimidating. Nontheless, I do think it's a game I can easily reccomend to a large amount of people owning to it's fantastic writing. 
        Funny, creative, and occasionally even downright touching. The game is easily one of the best space operas in video game history, only rivaled by the likes of Mass Effect(which took a lot of inspiration from Star Control 2). That's not even getting into the voice acting in the 3DO/Open Source version, which will probably not everybody's cup of tea is nontheless very well done. Soundtrack is great as well.
        Gameplay is a bit more mixed, though the suprising arcade like simplicity of much of it means it's aged more gracefully than expected. Mostly the difficulty, which for reasons I can't fully explain is not quite what it seems. Unless you use a walkthrough, and you really shouldn't for the most part, expect to have to restart the game once or twice. Also: Keep a notepad on hand and make sure you write down every clue. 
        Despite that difficulty, the game does have a rather relaxing quality to it. Simply exploring the galaxy is a lot of fun, in many ways this is probably the best unofficial Star Trek game ever made. Even the simple act of mining for resources is a game onto itself. It's not perfect, but when the game is fun it's really fun. And when it's not fun, the writing and story will generally have you overlook the problems.
