<h2>Basic description:</h2>
<p>
Thief: The Dark Project is a 1998 first-person stealth video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. Set in a fantasy metropolis called the City, players take on the role of Garrett, a master thief trained by a secret society who, while carrying out a series of robberies, becomes embroiled in a complex plot that ultimately sees him attempting to prevent a great power from unleashing chaos on the world.
Thief was the first PC stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics, and combined complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay. The game is notable for its use of first-person perspective for non-confrontational gameplay, which challenged the first-person shooter market and led the developers to call it a "first-person sneaker", while it also had influences in later stealth games such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Hitman.
The game received critical acclaim and has been placed on numerous hall-of-fame lists, achieving sales of half a million units by 2000, making it Looking Glass' most commercially successful game. It is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time and helped popularize the stealth genre. Thief was followed by an expanded edition entitled Thief Gold (1999) which modified certain missions and included a few brand new levels, two sequels: Thief II: The Metal Age (2000), and Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004), as well as a reboot of the series, Thief (2014). Thief was one of two games in the series that Looking Glass worked on before it was forced to close.

    <h2>Personal opinions:</h2>
    <p>Ah, Thief. Alongside Metal Gear Solid probably one of most influential stealth games ever made. As for how it is to play today, I would say good but with some major caveats. 
        The general stealth mechanics, despite the years and their simplicity, are pretty fun. There is a dynamism to the game, which is why many people refer to it as a immersive sim, that helps it generally stand apart from other stealth games both before and after it.  
        Main thing that holds it back is that the level design can be a bit mixed. Much hay tends to be made of the rather poor end game and the more combat oriented levels, but I would say even the more stealth focused once, while expertetly designed, are rather linear and don't take full advantage of what the game can do. You will have to play the sequel to see the game take it's ideas to it's logical conclusion.
        With that said, the main thing that elevates the game is the atmosphere. While the store is kept relativily minimal, though still fairly memorable due to it's great voice acting, writing, and cutscenes, the atmosphere is omnipresent. There's a clear artistry behind and sense of purpose behind it that even the relativily outdated graphics can't diminish. It's one of the main reasons why, despite everything, I would absolutly say the game is worth playing.</p>
