<h2>Basic description:</h2>
<p>
    Chrono Trigger[b] is a 1995 role-playing video game developed and published by Square. It was originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the first game in the Chrono series. The game's development team included three designers that Square dubbed the "Dream Team": Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Square's Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of Dragon Quest and author of the Dragon Ball manga series. In addition, Takashi Tokita co-directed the game and co-wrote the scenario, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,[1] Masato Kato wrote most of the story, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrote most of the soundtrack before falling ill and deferring the remaining tracks to Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2][3] The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.
    Chrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success upon release and is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of the game as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related side-quests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[4] Chrono Trigger was the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan,[5] and shipped 2.65 million copies worldwide by March 2003.[6] Excluding the PC version, the game had shipped over 3.5 million copies worldwide by February 2018.

<h2>Where to buy:</h2>
<p>Square released a ported version by Tose in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, which was later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles (2001) for the North American market. A slightly enhanced Chrono Trigger, again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan in 2008, and PAL regions in 2009.[7] The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, and Windows.</p>

    <h2>Personal opinions:</h2>
    <p>Chrono Trigger is generally seen as one of the best RPG games ever made and, quick as I am to offer a contarian opinion, I most certainly agree. It's am all time classic and most certainly a game I would reccomend to almost anybody with even the vaguest intrest in video games.</p> 
    <p>While the gameplay isn't particularly special, attacks are generally flashy and figths are well designed and memorable. At worst, I would say it can be a bit too easy (Though that also makes it a good game for people looking to get into JRPG's). The main draw, as is often the case with JRPG's, is the story. As well as the soundtrack, which is one of the best in video game history.</p>
    <p>On a final note, while the game is easily available the version on Steam is far from the best way to play the game(Though it has gotten way better apparently). If possible, try and track down the DS version. It's fairly expensive however, meaning you might want to rely on other sources.</p>
